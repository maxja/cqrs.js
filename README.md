CQRS learning playground
===

I've started this project to learn more about CQRS design pattern.

I'll be progressing on this topic while reading these books:

* Practical Microservices. Build Event-Driven Architectures with Event Sourcing
  and CQRS by Ethan Garofolo, 2020;
* Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing by Alex Lawrence, 2021;
* Exploring CQRS and Event Sourcing by Dominic Betts,
  Julian Domingez, Grigori Melnik, Fernando Simonazzi, Mani Subramanian, 2012.

I would leave some notes on what I've read. And I might add couple other books
to this list, later on.
