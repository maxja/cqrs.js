CQRS learning playground
===

I've started this project to learn more about CQRS design pattern.

I'll be progressing on this topic while reading these books:

[2]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56312766-implementing-ddd-cqrs-and-event-sourcing "Implementing DDD, CQRS and Event Sourcing by Alex Lawrence, 2021"

I would leave some notes on what I've read. And I might add couple other books to this list, later on.

Preface
---

[One book][2] gave brief term introduction about Domain-Driven Design — concept that focuses on the problem space and associated knowledge areas,
Command Query Responsibility Segregation — separates application onto two sides: read and write, and Event Sourcing — architectual pattern that represents
state as sequence of immutable events.
